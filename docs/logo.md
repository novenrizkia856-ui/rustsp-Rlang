The RustS+ logo is a geometric hexagon symbolizing structure, efficiency, and engineering systems. The outer solid black background represents the low-level system and core stability. Above it is an orange hexagonal border with sharp, precise corners, symbolizing the safety and energy boundaries of the process, inspired by Rust's safety philosophy. The inner hexagon is a dark industrial gray, reflecting a neutral, strong, and functional foundation. In the center of the hexagon is a bold, geometric “R” representing the foundation of Rust, with a smaller but more visually prominent “+” sign to the right of the R. The same orange “+” sign as the border represents augmentation, expansion, and additional layers of capabilities on top of Rust. The overall composition is minimalist, bold, and scalable, so it remains clear and distinctive at both small sizes such as the CLI icon and large sizes for official documentation and distribution.
